My PiTUBE-Client

The features are:

-use a config file  (~/.pitube/pitube.cfg) to save users audiomode and  the max.quality. If the program run the first time it will make this file (Default settings: audio over HDMI, max.quality = 18) 
-insert a string to search for on youtube (the programm will return all found videos on page one)
-browse trough the results (the program tell you the name and the length of every video)
-watch the recommended Videos (show all recommended videos that youtube would show you on the videos page â€“ still buggy)
